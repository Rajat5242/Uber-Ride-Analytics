# Uber-Ride-Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
### This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride booking data using MySQL to uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior, driver performance, and revenue impact. The aim is to go beyond basic reporting by answering advanced business questions such as revenue loss due to cancellations, peak earning hours, payment method preferences, rating trends, and cancellation patterns.

## End Goal
### The ultimate goal is to build a comprehensive analytics project that demonstrates the ability to translate raw ride data into actionable insights for business decision-making. This includes identifying areas of revenue leakage, understanding customer satisfaction trends, and optimizing operations based on data-driven findings.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
### Analyze cancellation patterns (customers vs drivers) and top reasons.
### Estimate monthly revenue loss due to cancellations and incomplete rides.
### Identify peak revenue hours by calculating average booking value per hour.
### Compare payment methods by average fare per ride and ride length.
### Explore customer rating trends and link low ratings with cancellation behavior.
### Identify high-value customers (based on lifetime revenue) and analyze their booking frequency, payment preferences, and ride distance trends.
